        <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1> 
        <p>Growing up in New York, my favorite restaurant was the Akron House. They had carrot cake, which was my favorite dessert. Here are my favorite desserts that I enjoyed at the Akron House:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Carrot Cake</li>
            <li>Cheesecake</li>
            <li>Chocolate Gelato</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Do I remember any of the mains from the many times I ate there as a child? Not at all. You can tell where my priorities lay at the time!</p>
