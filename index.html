        <h1>My Favorite Foods</h1> 
        <p>Growing up in Western New York, my favorite restaurant was the Akron House. They had carrot cake, which was one of my favorite desserts. Here are my favorite desserts that I enjoyed at the Akron House:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Carrot Cake</li>
            <li>Cheesecake</li>
            <li>Chocolate Gelato</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Do I remember any of the mains from the many times I ate there as a child? Not at all. You can tell where my priorities lay at the time! Unfortunately, the Akron House is closed now, but you can see some photos of what it used to be <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-akron-house-akron">HERE</a>. </p>
